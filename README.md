# Job Scheduling: Task Validation Enhancements

## Overview

This Python module models a job with multiple tasks, each having specific completion times and potential dependencies. The Job class ensures that tasks are executed in an order that respects their dependencies, and that all tasks have defined completion times.

## Brief Explanation of the Main Logic

First, tasks with no dependencies are added to the queue. We then start processing tasks by popping tasks from the queue one at a time. For each task we pop, we add it to the task_order list.

After processing the task, we check for any tasks that are dependent on the current task. If the current task is the last prerequisite that a dependent task requires, and that dependent task hasn't been processed yet, we add the dependent task to the queue.

Additionally, as we process each task, we update the minimum required time to begin the dependent task, based on the time taken to complete the current task and the dependent task's completion time.

## Validation Features

- **Task Completion Time Validation**: Ensures every task listed in the tasks list has a corresponding entry in the completion_times dictionary.
- **Task Dependency Validation**: Verifies that all tasks referenced as dependencies in the dependencies dictionary exist in the tasks list.

## Core Methods

- `validate_task_completion_times`: Checks that each task in tasks has a corresponding entry in completion_times.
- `validate_task_dependencies`: Ensures all tasks mentioned as dependencies are present in the tasks list.

## Usage Example

```python
tasks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
dependencies = {
    'D': ['A'],
    'E': ['B', 'C'],
    'F': ['D', 'E']
}
completion_times = {
    'A': 3,
    'B': 2,
    'C': 4,
    'D': 5,
    'E': 2,
    'F': 3
}

job = Job(tasks, dependencies, completion_times)
min_time, task_order = job.get_minimum_completion_time()
print(f"Minimum completion time: {min_time} units")
print(f"Task order: {task_order}")
```

If any validation fails, an appropriate ValueError will be raised, detailing the issue.
